Score
=====

See the full API for the module at :ref:`score_module`.

The Score class encapsulates the functionality for computing and storing
"scores" of atomic environments or atomic configurations. Common examples would
be UQ metrics or "importance" scores.

An
:class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.score_base.AtomCenteredScore`
is computed for each local atomic environment (an atom and its neighbors within a
cutoff). An example would be an LTAU UQ metric.
:class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.score_base.ConfigurationScore`
is computed for an entire supercell. An example would be a FIM.

Designing a Score Module
------------------------

If you are developing a new Score module, then it will be useful to
understand a few key design choices that were made.

When executing a calcuation using the ``run()`` function, the arguments used
for initializing a Computer, and the arguments passed to the ``compute()``
call, will be written out to temporary folders. This is done so that the module
can be re-initialized and the calculation can be performed within a batch job
that may not have access to the original class instance. In the case of
array-like arguments, these values will be saved as .npy file. In order to
support this functionality, you should make sure that your ``__init__()``
function can optionally read any array-like arguments from a file. These files
will be removed by the ``cleanup()`` function once the job is completed.

LTAU Forces UQ Score
--------------------

The :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.ltau.LTAUForcesUQScore` module provides
ensemble-based uncertainty quantification for force predictions. This module uses
distributions of force error magnitudes sampled over the course of training to
estimate uncertainty for each atom. For test atoms, a nearest-neighbor search
is performed in descriptor space using the FAISS library.

Key features:

* Supports building PDFs from error logs or pre-computed distributions
* Uses FAISS for efficient nearest-neighbor search in descriptor space
* Configurable binning strategies (linear or logarithmic spacing)
* Multiple index types supported (IndexFlatL2, IndexHNSWFlat, etc.)

Usage example::

    ltau_score = LTAUForcesUQScore(
        train_descriptors=descriptors,  # (num_atoms, num_dimensions)
        error_pdfs=error_logs,  # (num_epochs, num_atoms)
        index_type='IndexFlatL2',
        from_error_logs=True,
        nbins=100,
    )

    uncertainties = ltau_score.compute_batch(
        dataset,  # list of ASE Atoms
        ScoreQuantity.UNCERTAINTY,
        descriptors_key='descriptors',
        num_nearest_neighbors=5
    )

QUESTS Score Modules
--------------------

The QUESTS modules provide information-theoretic measures of dataset quality
using kernel density estimation. Three complementary scores are available:

**QUESTSEfficiencyScore**
   Measures dataset efficiency as the ratio H/maxH, quantifying how little
   redundancy the dataset contains. Values near 1 indicate minimal oversampling.

**QUESTSDiversityScore**
   Estimates how well the dataset covers the configuration space it spans.
   Higher values indicate better coverage of the accessible regions.

**QUESTSDeltaEntropyScore**
   Computes per-atom estimates of entropy increase when adding points to a
   reference set. Useful for identifying configurations that would add the
   most information.

All QUESTS modules use Gaussian kernel density estimation with configurable
bandwidth and support optional environment selection masks.

Usage examples::

    # Dataset efficiency
    efficiency_score = QUESTSEfficiencyScore()
    efficiency = efficiency_score.compute(
        dataset=dataset,  # list of ASE Atoms
        score_quantity=ScoreQuantity.EFFICIENCY,
        descriptors_key='descriptors',
        bandwidth=0.1
    )

    # Per-atom delta entropy
    delta_entropy_score = QUESTSDeltaEntropyScore()
    delta_entropies = delta_entropy_score.compute_batch(
        dataset,  # list of ASE Atoms
        ScoreQuantity.DELTA_ENTROPY,
        reference_set=descriptors,  # (num_atoms, num_dimensions)
        bandwidth=0.1,
        descriptors_key='descriptors',
    )

Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) Modules
---------------------------------------

In theory, the FIM measures the expected information that data contains about
potential parameters. Assuming a Gaussian likelihood, the FIM can be calculated
by taking the dot product between the Jacobian matrix with itself, where the
Jacobian contains the partial derivative of the correspoding model output with
respect to its parameters. This concept is further utilized in the
information-matching method [1]_ for active learning.

There are three separate FIM modules that are needed to use the
information-matching method. These modules are typically used in the following
order: (1) use :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_training_set.FIMTrainingSetScore`
to compute the FIM of each atomic configuration using the training quantities,
e.g. configuration energy and atomic forces, (2) use
:class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_property.FIMPropertyScore` to
compute the FIM of the target properties, and (3) use
:class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_matching.FIMMatchingScore`
to use information-matching method to compute the optimal weight for each
candidate atomic configuration.

.. note::
   :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_training_set.FIMTrainingSetScore`
   and :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_property.FIMPropertyScore`
   are currently only compatible with :class:`~orchestrator.potential.kim.KIMPotential`.
   Furthermore, :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_property.FIMPropertyScore`
   only supports the potentials capable of writing parameters.
   :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_matching.FIMMatchingScore` only
   uses the FIMs computed by the other two calculations and does not require
   a potential.

The FIM computed using :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_training_set.FIMTrainingSetScore`
or :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_property.FIMPropertyScore`
approximates the Hessian of the potential. Specifically, each element at row
:math:`i`, column :math:`j` represents the second derivative of the potential
predictions with respect to the parameters at indices :math:`i` and :math:`j`.
The mapping between parameter indices and their corresponding parameters is
stored in `fim_index_to_parameter` attribute.

As an example consider computing the FIM for the Stillinger-Weber potential
in OpenKIM, with KIM ID `SW_StillingerWeber_1985_Si__MO_405512056662_006 <https://openkim.org/id/SW_StillingerWeber_1985_Si__MO_405512056662_006>`_.
We take derivatives only with respect to parameters :math:`A` and :math:`B` by
specifying::

  parameters_optimize={
      'A': [[15.2848479197914]],
      'B': [['default']],
      'lambda': [[0.0, 'fix']]
  }

This results in a :math:`2 \times 2` FIM, where:

- The (0, 0) element corresponds to the second derivative w.r.t. :math:`A`,
- The (0, 1) and (1, 0) elements correspond to mixed derivatives w.r.t.
  :math:`A` and :math:`B`,
- The (1, 1) element corresponds to the second derivative w.r.t. :math:`B`.

The attribute `fim_index_to_parameter` outputs::

  {
      0: {"parameter": "A", "extent": 0},
      1: {"parameter": "B", "extent": 0}
  }

Here, the dictionary keys represent parameter indices, while the values contain
the parameter name and its extent. If a parameter has multiple values
(e.g., different interaction types), extent reflects this structure.

FIMTrainingSetScore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module is used to compute the FIM of energy, forces, etc. of each atomic
configuration. The derivative is done numerically using `numdifftools` Python
package, which uses Richardson's extrapolation to achieve high-accuracy
derivative estimation.

As an example, suppose we want to compute the FIM for a Stillinger-Weber
potential for silicon, which is stored in `OpenKIM <https://openkim.org/>`_.
The KIM ID for this potential is
`SW_StillingerWeber_1985_Si__MO_405512056662_006 <https://openkim.org/id/SW_StillingerWeber_1985_Si__MO_405512056662_006>`_.
Let's compute the FIM for the atomic forces quantity only (no energy or
stress), and we take the derivative with respect to the two-body energy scaling
parameters (i.e., A and B).

An example code to do this calculation using
:class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_training_set.FIMTrainingSetScore`
is given below.::

  from orchestrator.computer.score.fim import FIMTrainingSetScore
  from ase.io import read

  # Candidate configurations as ase.Atoms objects
  # candidate_configurations.xyz is just a dummy configuration file name.
  list_of_atoms = read('candidate_configurations.xyz', format='extxyz', index=':')
  nconfigs = len(list_of_atoms)

  # Compute the FIM for each atomic configuration
  myfim_training_set = FIMTrainingSetScore()
  fim_training_set = myfim_training_set.compute_batch(
      list_of_atoms=list_of_atoms,
      score_quantity='SENSITIVITY',  # This value should be changed
      potential={
          'potential_type': 'KIM',
          'potential_args': {
              'kim_id': 'SW_StillingerWeber_1985_Si__MO_405512056662_006',
              'kim_api': 'kim-api-collections-management'
	  }
      },
      parameters_optimize={
          'A': [[15.2848479197914]],
          'B': [['default']],
          'lambda': [[0.0, 'fix']]
      },
      # Optional - The defult is to compute the forces only
      evaluate_kwargs={
          'compute_energy': [False] * nconfigs,
	  'compute_forces': [True] * nconfigs,
	  'compute_stress': [False] * nconfigs
      },
      # Optional - The default is to use central difference method with step
      # size 10% of the potential parameters. This argument is passed in as
      # keyword arguments to numdifftools.Jacobian.
      derivative_kwargs={'method': 'central'}
  )

  # Save the results to score_results.xyz
  myfim_training_set.save_results(
      compute_results=fim_training_set, list_of_configs=list_of_atoms)

.. note::

   Energy, force, and stress have different physical units. Since
   :class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_training_set.FIMTrainingSetScore`
   does not handle the weighting of these quantities internally, each
   configuration should be used to compute only **one** quantity at a time.
   Specifically, there should be exactly one `True` value among the
   `compute_energy`, `compute_forces`, and `compute_stress` keys in the
   `evaluate_kwargs` argument.

   If multiple quantities need to be evaluated for the same configuration, the
   configuration should be duplicated, with each duplicate assigned a different
   quantity.

When computing the FIM using atomic forces quantity, one can pass a binary
masking array, e.g., `[1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, to include or exclude rows of the
Jacobian, effectively include and exclude the prediction contribution of
certain atoms in the configuration. For the specific masking array example
above, it excludes the cartesian force components acting on the second atom.

.. note::

   If there are multiple atomic configurations, one masking array should be
   specified for each of them. A special value is `None`, in which case there
   is no rows in the Jacobian excluded. A `.npy` or `.txt` file that contains
   the masking array that can be read via `np.load` or `np.loadtxt` can also be
   used.



FIMPropertyScore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module is used to estimate the FIM of the target property, such as elastic
constants. Since the target property calculations are typically expensive, the
derivative is estimated numerically using regular finite difference method.

As an example, suppose we want to compute the FIM for the elastic constant of
diamond silicon. Let's still use the same SW potential with the same set of
potential parameters. For information-matching calculation, we also need to
specify a target covariance matrix for the target property. The information-
matching calculation will determine a set of optimal weights for the training
configurations such that the uncertainty of the target property is smaller than
this target covariance. For simplicity, we can assume that the target
covariance for this example is just an identity matrix.

An example code to do this calculation using
:class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_property.FIMPropertyScore` is
given below.::

  from orchestrator.computer.score.fim import FIMPropertyScore
  import numpy as np

  myfim_property = FIMPropertyScore()
  fim_property = myfim_property.compute(
      list_of_target_property=[
          {
              'init_args': {
                  'target_property_type': 'ElasticConstants',
                  'target_property_args': {
                      'lattice_param': 5.43,
                      'lattice_type': 'diamond',
                      'deformation_mag': 0.0001,
                      'simulator_path':
                      '/PATH/TO/lmp',
                      'elements': ['Si']
                  }
              },
              'calculate_property_args': {
                  'workflow': {
                      'workflow_type': 'LOCAL',
                      'workflow_args': {}
                  }
              }
          }
      ],
      score_quantity='SENSITIVITY',  # This value should be changed
      cov=np.eye(36),  # Target covariance matrix for the target properties
      potential={
          'potential_type': 'KIM',
          'potential_args': {
              'kim_id': 'SW_StillingerWeber_1985_Si__MO_405512056662_006',
              'kim_api': 'kim-api-collections-management'
	  }
      },
      parameters_optimize={
          'A': [[15.2848479197914]],
          'B': [['default']],
          'lambda': [[0.0, 'fix']]
      },
      # Optional - Additional argument for the finite difference derivative,
      # which only includes the step size and string pointer for the method.
      derivative_kwargs={'h': 0.1, 'method': 'CD'},
  )

  # Save the results to score_results.json
  myfim_property.save_results(compute_results=fim_property)



FIMMatchingScore
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module wraps over Python package
`information-matching <https://github.com/yonatank93/information-matching>`_
to compute the optimal weight to assign to each candidate atomic configurations.
This calculation requires the other FIM calculations first.

Continuing with the examples above, we can use the following code to compute the
optimal weights for the configuration using
:class:`~orchestrator.computer.score.fim.fim_matching.FIMMatchingScore`::

  from orchestrator.computer.score.fim import FIMMatchingScore
  from ase.io import read

  # Load the FIMs
  list_of_atoms = read('score_results.xyz', format='extxyz', index=':')
  fim_property = 'score_results.json'

  # information-matching calculation
  myfim_matching = FIMMatchingScore()
  fim_matching = myfim_matching.compute_batch(
      list_of_atoms=list_of_atoms,
      fim_property=fim_property,
      score_quantity='IMPORTANCE',  # This value should be changed
      # Optional - keyword arguments to instantiate information_matching.ConvexOpt
      convexopt_init_kwargs={'weight_upper_bound': None},
      # Optional - keyword arguments to solve convex optimization problem via
      # cvxpy
      solver_kwargs={'solver': 'SDPA', 'verbose': True},
      # Optional - tolerances for extracting non-zero weights
      weight_tolerance={'zero_tol': 1e-4, 'zero_tol_dual': 1e-4}
  )

  # Save the results to score_results.xyz
  myfim_matching.save_results(compute_results=fim_matching, list_of_configs=list_of_atoms)
  print(fim_matching)
