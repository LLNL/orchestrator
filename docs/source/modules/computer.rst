Computer
========

The Computer class provides an API and some basic functionality for the
execution of generic calculations. Similar to the Recorder class, the Computer
is meant to be inherited by other base classes in order to ensure that they
obey the expected API and to avoid duplicating some boilerplate code. Due to
the generic nature of Computer, different sub-classes may have significantly
different implementations of the core functions.

In general, any sub-class of Computer is expected to support at least one of
four possible execution modes:

   * **in-memory, single input**: the ``compute()`` method is meant to be called
      in-memory (e.g. from an interactive terminal, or within a script) for computing
      the value of interest for a single input.

   * **in-memory, multiple input**: by implementing ``compute_batch()``, a sub-class may
      additionally support batched evaluation.

   * **workflow, single input**: if ``compute()`` is already implemented, then
      implementing ``get_run_command()`` will allow for execution of ``compute()`` across
      a (possibly distributed) workflow .

   * **workflow, multiple input**: ``get_batched_run_command()`` may be a modified
      version of ``get_run_command()`` which leverages ``compute_batch()`` for batched
      workflow execution.

ColabFit Integration
--------------------
In order for a value computed by a Computer to be stored in a ColabFit
database, it is necessary to first define a "property definition" and a
"property map". These should be supported by implementing
`get_colabfit_property_definition` and `get_colabfit_property_map`.

A property definition specifies all of the fields that are necessary to
uniquely define an instance of a computed property. For example, when storing
an atomic environment descriptor, you may need to specify the radial cutoff
distance that was used when calculating the descriptor in order to distinguish
it from other descriptors computed with different cutoffs.

The property definitions used by ColabFit follow the format described at
https://openkim.org/doc/schema/properties-framework/. As a simple example, one
might use the following property definition for an atomic environment
descriptor:

.. code-block:: python

   {
      "property-name": 'atomic-environment-descriptor',

      "property-title": "My Custom Atomic Environment Descriptor",

      "property-description": "A simple example descriptor",

      "descriptors": {
         "type": "float",  # "string", "float", "int", "bool", or "file"
         "has-unit": False,
         "extent": [":", ":"],  # a 2D array with unspecified lengths
         "required": True,
         "description": "The per-atom descriptors.",
      },
      "cutoff-distance": {  # NOTE: only lowercase alphanumeric and dashes
         "type": "float",
         "has-unit": True,  # some values may have units
         "extent": [],  # a scalar value
         "required": True,
         "description": "The cutoff distance",
   }

A property map is used by ColabFit to specify where on an ASE.Atoms object the
property values are stored. ColabFit will use the "field" values to search for
the computed values in the `.info` and `.arrays` dictionaries. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   {
      'descriptors': {
            'field': "descriptors",  # a per-atom value stored in .arrays
            'units': None
      },
      'cutuff-distance': {
            'field': 'cutoff-distance'  # a scalar value stored in .info
            'units': 'Ang'  # to specify the units of the value
      }
   }
