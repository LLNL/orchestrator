Executor
========

The Executor module serves as the driver for using the Orchestrator in "application mode" - providing a single input file and allowing the executor to handle the coordination and flow of separate Orchestrator modules.

The Executor module has been used in a developmental setting, but is not refined for widespread use at this time. The rest of Orchestrator can still be used as standalone components or as part of custom scripts leveraging the Orchestrator as a library in the meantime.
