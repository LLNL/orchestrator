        AT LEAST ONE of either kim_id or model_name_prefix is REQUIRED
        to save a potential to KIMkit.

        This is because When saving a new model it must be assigned a
        kimcode, a structured unique id code of the form

        Human_Readable_Prefix__MO_000000999999_000

        Each kimcode begins With a human-readable prefix (containing
        letters, numbers, and underscores, and starting with a letter).
        Then, there's a 2-letter code corresponding to
        the type of model; MO for portable-models that implement
        their executable code internally or in a standalone model-driver,
        and SM for simulator-models that wrap commands to a KIM-compatible
        simulator software like LAMMPS. Then, there's a unique 12-digit ID
        number that identifies the item, and finally a 3-digit version number.

        You can simply provide the human-readable prefix
        as "model_name_prefix" and this method will generate a new
        kimcode and assign it as this potential's kim_id, beginning
        with version 000.

        Otherwise, you can manually generate a kimcode yourself by
        passing the same human-readable prefix to
        kimkit.kimcodes.generate_new_kim_id(prefix, kim_item_type)
        which will return a new unique kimcode. Then you can simply
